# How to solder

I started building out my [Atreus](https://atreus.technomancy.us/) keyboard today and the first step was to solder some diodes. I'd not really soldered before and the [assembly guide](https://atreus.technomancy.us/assembly.pdf) referenced the [Ada Fruit Guide to Soldering](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering/tools). This guide was awesome and really gave me some confidence to start my assembly.

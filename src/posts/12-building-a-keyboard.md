# Building a keyboard

I've been wanting to get into building a physical hardware something. A keyboard seemed like a pretty good place to start.

I started searching the internet for people that have done such a thing, and it turns out there are a lot and people have done it different ways.

* Complete DIY - [My First Keyboard Build](http://www.davecooper.org/blog/2014/10/15/i-built-a-keyboard/)
* In days gone by there were [Group Buys](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=23572.0)
* And kits like [ErgoDox](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/ergodox) and [Atreus](http://atreus.technomancy.us)

I started down the complete DIY path, and found some good suppliers for parts. But it was turning out to be a lot of work in something that I was confident would work at the end. So instead I went for the [Atreus](http://atreus.technomancy.us) kit.

The website has an ordering form and I received a personal email from [@technomancy](https://twitter.com/technomancy) giving some options for payment. I paid and within a week or so I received the kit.

The instructions were super helpful and went to the level of complete beginner by explaining things step by step. Which is great for someone who is [science dogging](https://thesciencedog.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/golden-retriever-and-science1.jpg) it.

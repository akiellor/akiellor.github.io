# JavaScript copy paste detection

A common problem in software development is keeping your software DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). Tools have been around for a long time to detect where the code could be more DRY, these tools are lovingly called 'Copy Paste Detectors'.

They typically come in two flavours, line based and [Abstract Syntax Tree][ast] based.

## Line CPD

A line based copy paste detector is a language agnostic detector which essentially uses 'string searching algorithms' to find duplicates.

The [PMD][pmd] copy paste detector for example uses the [Rabinâ€“Karp algorithm][rabin-karp] for finding duplicates. This in many cases works reasonably well, but is essentially just looking at the code as a sequence of characters rather than looking into the inherent structure of the language.

## Abstract Syntax Tree CPD

An Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) based CPD will instead parse the source code into a language specific AST (which a compiler would typically do as part of the compilation process) and finds duplications within the syntax tree.

For example, the javascript source code:

```
var i = 1;
```

The [Esprima](http://esprima.org) parser emits the following AST:

```
{
  "type": "Program",
  "body": [
    {
      "type": "VariableDeclaration",
      "declarations": [
        {
          "type": "VariableDeclarator",
          "id": {
            "type": "Identifier",
            "name": "i"
          },
          "init": {
            "type": "Literal",
            "value": 1,
            "raw": "1"
          }
        }
      ],
      "kind": "var"
    }
  ],
  "sourceType": "script"
}
```

The AST copy paste detector will then walk from the leaves to the root, hashing the nodes of the tree. The hash of each node would typically be a hash of its own properties and the hash of any child nodes.

The following animation demonstrates the depth first traversal, hashing all attributes of each node with a **SHA**.

These tools will record both the hash of the AST node and the source location where that hash was encountered and create a report of incidents where duplicate hashes occur.

This approach is more accurate in detecting duplications of code that does not have identical source, but is semantically the same. For example:

```javascript
var a = 1;
```

```javascript
var a     =       1;
```

Also, the AST approach can support *fuzzy* duplication checks, allowing a user to find duplications where the code is essentially the same but has some minor adjustments.

This is achieved by introducing a hash function that will create [collisions][hash_collisions] for content that is deemed similar. For example, if a hash function is created such that hashing any *Identifier* node results in the same hash value, then the following snippets would have identical hashes, and thus identified as a *duplicate*.

```javascript
for(let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  doThing(i);
}
```

```javascript
for(let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  doAnotherThing(i);
}
```

This approach is described further in the paper [Clone Detection Using Abstract Syntax Trees][clone-detection-paper].

If folks are interested in an implementation of this approach for JavaScript, feel free to have a look at [patterns.js][patterns-github]. Feedback on this project or this post is very welcome.

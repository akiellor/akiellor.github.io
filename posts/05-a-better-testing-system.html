<h1>A Better Test System</h1>
<p>After working on a number of projects Iâ€™ve observed a constant tension on the topic of <em>end to end tests</em> or <em>system tests</em>. This tension comes from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coverage vs Speed</li>
<li>Inefficient, tests re-run the same steps to make a different assertion</li>
<li>Confidence in lower level tests</li>
<li>Difficulty in changing
<ul>
<li>Often slow, so testing a change can be time consuming</li>
<li>Requires good up-front organisation, with ongoing widespread understanding of organisation to stem the test proliferation problem.</li>
<li>Difficult to know which tests are similar without sitting and reading each test</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Difficult/manual to tailor suite for different purposes i.e. smoke check, happy path, high value or regression.</li>
</ul>

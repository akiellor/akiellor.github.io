<h1 id="a-foray-into-kernel-development">A foray into Kernel Development</h1>
<p>Off the back of a couple of discussions with colleagues about unikernels and the tooling that is sprouting to support the idea, I decided to learn a little more about kernel development.</p>
<p><a href="http://wiki.osdev.org/">OS Dev</a> provided a pretty good starting point with its <a href="http://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones">Bare Bones</a> tutorial. This tutorial takes you through to having a working &#39;Hello World&#39; kernel. It mostly includes all the required code samples. The most difficult part of this tutorial was getting a gcc cross compiler working. OS Dev has a tutorial <a href="http://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler">GCC Cross Compiling</a>, but it was filled with manual steps and I struggled to get something working. Thankfully there had been some work to script the cross compilation by another tutorial <a href="http://preshing.com/20141119/how-to-build-a-gcc-cross-compiler">How to build a GCC Cross-Compiler</a>, the scripted solution worked almost unaltered.</p>
<p>You can find the resulting kernel here <a href="http://github.com/akiellor/hello-kernel">Hello Kernel</a>.</p>

<h1>Building a keyboard</h1>
<p>Iâ€™ve been wanting to get into building a physical hardware something. A keyboard seemed like a pretty good place to start.</p>
<p>I started searching the internet for people that have done such a thing, and it turns out there are a lot and people have done it different ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete DIY - <a href="http://www.davecooper.org/blog/2014/10/15/i-built-a-keyboard/">My First Keyboard Build</a></li>
<li>In days gone by there were <a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=23572.0">Group Buys</a></li>
<li>And kits like <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/buy/ergodox">ErgoDox</a> and <a href="http://atreus.technomancy.us">Atreus</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I started down the complete DIY path, and found some good suppliers for parts. But it was turning out to be a lot of work in something that I was confident would work at the end. So instead I went for the <a href="http://atreus.technomancy.us">Atreus</a> kit.</p>
<p>The website has an ordering form and I received a personal email from <a href="https://twitter.com/technomancy">@technomancy</a> giving some options for payment. I paid and within a week or so I received the kit.</p>
<h2>Unboxing</h2>

<p>The kit includes all the parts required to build the keyboard as well as the instructions. Definitely read the instructions, they were super helpful and went to the level of complete beginner by explaining things step by step. Which is great for someone who is <a href="https://thesciencedog.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/golden-retriever-and-science1.jpg">science dogging</a> it.</p>
<h2>Diodes</h2>
<p>Since I had decided not to apply the finish to the keyboard, I jumped straight into soldering the diodes. This was the first time I had ever soldered something, so this was nerve-racking. The instructions did include some good links to soldering tutorials which did give some confidence.</p>

<h2>Microcontroller</h2>

<p>The Atreus Keyboard uses a A-Star microcontroller to handle all the switch signals. Soldering it to the board was a little more tricky than the diodes as the contact points were much closer together and any slag could at best make the keyboard behave unpredictably and at worst be completely broken. I took a lot of time here, but maybe should not have, as I ended up scorching the microcontroller in a few places.</p>
<h2>Switches</h2>
<p>With the controller in, next up are the switches. The instructions recommended starting with the corner four switches, then the lowest row and the right most column. With a complete row and column it is possible to debug all the pins connected to the controller.</p>

<h1 id="javascript-copy-paste-detection">JavaScript copy paste detection</h1>
<p>A common problem in software development is keeping your software DRY (Don&#39;t Repeat Yourself). Tools have been around for a long time to detect where the code could be more DRY, these tools are lovingly called &#39;Copy Paste Detectors&#39;.</p>
<p>They typically come in two flavours, line based and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract Syntax Tree</a> based.</p>
<h2 id="line-cpd">Line CPD</h2>
<p>A line based copy paste detector is a language agnostic detector which essentially uses &#39;string searching algorithms&#39; to find duplicates.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://pmd.github.io">PMD</a> copy paste detector for example uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm">Rabin–Karp algorithm</a> for finding duplicates. This in many cases works reasonably well, but is essentially just looking at the code as a sequence of characters rather than looking into the inherent structure of the language.</p>
<h2 id="abstract-syntax-tree-cpd">Abstract Syntax Tree CPD</h2>
<p>An Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) based CPD will instead parse the source code into a language specific AST (which a compiler would typically do as part of the compilation process) and finds duplications within the syntax tree.</p>
<p>For example, the javascript source code:</p>
<pre><code>var i = 1;
</code></pre><p>The <a href="http://esprima.org">Esprima</a> parser emits the following AST:</p>
<pre><code>{
  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Program&quot;,
  &quot;body&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;VariableDeclaration&quot;,
      &quot;declarations&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;type&quot;: &quot;VariableDeclarator&quot;,
          &quot;id&quot;: {
            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Identifier&quot;,
            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;i&quot;
          },
          &quot;init&quot;: {
            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Literal&quot;,
            &quot;value&quot;: 1,
            &quot;raw&quot;: &quot;1&quot;
          }
        }
      ],
      &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;var&quot;
    }
  ],
  &quot;sourceType&quot;: &quot;script&quot;
}
</code></pre><p>The AST copy paste detector will then walk from the leaves to the root, hashing the nodes of the tree. The hash of each node would typically be a hash of its own properties and the hash of any child nodes.</p>
<p>The following animation demonstrates the depth first traversal, hashing all attributes of each node with a <strong>SHA</strong>.</p>

<p>These tools will record both the hash of the AST node and the source location where that hash was encountered and create a report of incidents where duplicate hashes occur.</p>
<p>This approach is more accurate in detecting duplications of code that does not have identical source, but is semantically the same. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">var a = 1;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">var a     =       1;
</code></pre>
<p>Also, the AST approach can support <em>fuzzy</em> duplication checks, allowing a user to find duplications where the code is essentially the same but has some minor adjustments.</p>
<p>This is achieved by introducing a hash function that will create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_(computer_science)">collisions</a> for content that is deemed similar. For example, if a hash function is created such that hashing any <em>Identifier</em> node results in the same hash value, then the following snippets would have identical hashes, and thus identified as a <em>duplicate</em>.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">for(let i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
  doThing(i);
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">for(let i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
  doAnotherThing(i);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This approach is described further in the paper <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/leonardo/files/ICSM98.pdf">Clone Detection Using Abstract Syntax Trees</a>.</p>
<p>If folks are interested in an implementation of this approach for JavaScript, feel free to have a look at <a href="https://github.com/akiellor/patterns.js">patterns.js</a>. Feedback on this project or this post is very welcome.</p>

<h1>Frankenstein JavaScript Generator</h1>
<p>While implementing the Copy Paste Detector I wrote about in my last post, I realised it would be super useful to have a tool that could generate javascript.</p>
<p>With a bit of research, I found that there is a tool called <a href="https://github.com/estools/escodegen">escodegen</a>, that takes a JavaScript AST and prints it as regular JavaScript string. So all I needed to do was have something that could generate some AST and the printing part would be sorted.</p>
<h2>In the beginning</h2>
<p>The first pass at the generator was pretty basic. The implementation of this was basically a giant switch statement where for each node type there was a definition of how to generate it, which may be written in terms of other generated node types. Example pseudo code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">generate</span>(<span class="hljs-params">nodeType</span>) </span>{
  <span class="hljs-keyword">switch</span> (nodeType) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">case</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Identifier"</span>:
      <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> {type: <span class="hljs-string">"Identifier"</span>, name: <span class="hljs-string">"foo"</span>}
    <span class="hljs-keyword">case</span> <span class="hljs-string">"FunctionDeclaration"</span>:
      <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> {
        type: <span class="hljs-string">"FunctionDeclaration"</span>,
        id: generate(<span class="hljs-string">"Identifier"</span>),
        params: [],
        body: []
      };
    ...
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This approach was super tedious to implement, and resulted in many cases where node types would need to be grouped together. The above example generates a function declaration with no body statements, to fix this you need to have some idea of what the valid node types for that section of AST.</p>
<p>Instead of rethinking, I pushed forward, extending the switch to have some groups of things like Statements which would be randomly sampled from things considered to be Statements:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">generate</span>(<span class="hljs-params">nodeType</span>) </span>{
  <span class="hljs-keyword">switch</span> (nodeType) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">case</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Identifier"</span>:
      <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> {type: <span class="hljs-string">"Identifier"</span>, name: <span class="hljs-string">"foo"</span>}
    <span class="hljs-keyword">case</span> <span class="hljs-string">"FunctionDeclaration"</span>:
      <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> {
        type: <span class="hljs-string">"FunctionDeclaration"</span>,
        id: generate(<span class="hljs-string">"Identifier"</span>),
        params: [],
        body: [
          generate(<span class="hljs-string">"Statement"</span>)
        ]
      };
    <span class="hljs-keyword">case</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Statement"</span>:
      <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> type = sample([<span class="hljs-string">"ExpressionStatement"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"FunctionDeclaration"</span>]);
      <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> generate(type);
    ...
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>At the end, there was a <strong>working</strong> solution (if you ignore the stack-overflow errors). But we can do better…</p>
<h2>Round 2</h2>
<p>I had heard a bunch of people talk about Markov Chains and how they can be used to generate sequences of English text (similar to <a href="https://swiftkey.com/en">SwiftKey</a>), and that was about all I knew. But it seemed something Markov-y could help me.</p>
<p>There was an example on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Wikipedia</a> entry which described a creatures eating habits as the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>It eats exactly once a day.</li>
<li>If it ate cheese today, tomorrow it will eat lettuce or grapes with equal probability.</li>
<li>If it ate grapes today, tomorrow it will eat grapes with probability 1/10, cheese with probability 4/10 and lettuce with probability 5/10.</li>
<li>If it ate lettuce today, tomorrow it will eat grapes with probability 4/10 or cheese with probability 6/10. It will not eat lettuce again tomorrow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Looks like if we replace food with JavaScript AST node properties we are in business. So the first sample model looked something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>a FunctionDeclaration <code>id</code> is always an Identifier</li>
<li>a FunctionDeclaration <code>params</code> is always an list of Identifier’s</li>
<li>a FunctionDeclaration <code>body</code> is 3/1 split between an ExpressionStatement and another FunctionDeclaration</li>
<li>an ExpressionStatement always has an Identifier expression</li>
<li>an Identifier always has a name of “foo”</li>
</ul>
<p>And in data form:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">{
  <span class="hljs-string">"FunctionDeclaration.id"</span>: {
    <span class="hljs-string">"Identifier"</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>
  },
  <span class="hljs-string">"FunctionDeclaration.params[]"</span>: {
    <span class="hljs-string">"Identifier"</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>
  },
  <span class="hljs-string">"FunctionDeclaration.body[]"</span>: {
    <span class="hljs-string">"ExpressionStatement"</span>: <span class="hljs-number">3</span>,
    <span class="hljs-string">"FunctionDeclaration"</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>
  },
  <span class="hljs-string">"ExpressionStatement.expression"</span>: {
    <span class="hljs-string">"Identifier"</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>
  },
  <span class="hljs-string">"Identifier.name"</span>: {
    <span class="hljs-string">"foo"</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>It is important to note that this model is not entirely complete, in that some elements are only valid at certain positions within a node array e.g. a ReturnStatement can only occur at the end of a FunctionDeclaration.body.</strong></p>
<p>When generating FunctionDeclarations, this model creates things like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params">foo</span>) </span>{
 foo
}
</code></pre>
<p>OR</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params">foo</span>) </span>{
  <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params">foo</span>) </span>{
    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params">foo</span>) </span>{
      foo
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The generate function was refactored to take the desired node type and the model being used to generate from. The new javascript generator was considerably smaller in size, because the logic of what nodes are allowed where was not embedded in the generator, but in the model. But this sample model is so boring, so the next step was to build a tool to create these models from existing code.</p>
<h2>Beyond foo foo foo</h2>
<p>With the model roughly sketched out, the analyser would simply have to traverse some javascript code and count instances of node types at different properties with the exclusion of Literals and Identifiers which would need to collect the values.</p>
<p>The library <a href="https://github.com/substack/node-falafel">falafel</a> gives a nice API for traversing a JavaScript AST, this made it super easy to collect statistics from existing javascript code.</p>
<h2>Putting it together</h2>
<p>With the analyser and generator complete with a utility command line interface, it was possible to extract statistics from an existing library and generate new javascript from those statistics.</p>
<p>The following uses the React library as a source for statistics and generates the following code.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// cat react.js | ./bin/analyse | ./bin/generate</span>

(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">r</span>) </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> ReactInstanceHandles = <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>._callbacks.getReactRootIDFromNodeID(<span class="hljs-number">30</span>);
}(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">styleName</span>) </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> element = _dereq_(targetID);
}));
</code></pre>
<p>But you don’t need to stop with statistics from one library, it is possible to analyse multiple libraries and generate from the combined statistics.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// cat angular.js react.js | ./bin/analyse | ./bin/generate</span>

(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">e</span>(<span class="hljs-params">window</span>) </span>{
    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">beginPhase</span>(<span class="hljs-params">bookKeeping</span>) </span>{
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (map.keyCode === <span class="hljs-string">'string'</span>) {
            selectCtrl.retrievalMethod(<span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.selected);
        } <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
            <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (offset) {
                ReactElementValidator.push({ noValidate: <span class="hljs-number">140</span> });
            } <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
                <span class="hljs-built_in">Array</span>.expect(newIsolateScopeDirective);
            }
        }
    }
}(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">valueWatchAction</span>(<span class="hljs-params">module</span>) </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (key <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> listenerBank) {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (!headers) {
            <span class="hljs-built_in">Object</span>.invoke(arg);
        } <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
            cachedState = <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>;
        }
    }
}));

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Getting to this solution was really fun. I was able to iteratively solve the original problem of randomly generating JavaScript and with every iteration I learned a little about JavaScript AST processing and Markov Chains.</p>
<p>The statistical model still doesn’t track many features of the analysed code, so can not be considered done. It could be interesting to have the analysis pass extract a model that would with certainty generate the original code, this would mean that all code features a being accounted.</p>
<p>Another extension could be to use the statistical model to drive some IDE auto-completion. It would be great if IDE’s were able to predict what code was coming next based on the code that has already been written.</p>
<p>If you are interested in looking at the code that makes these things possible, feel free to have a look at <a href="https://github.com/akiellor/generate.js">generate.js</a>.</p>

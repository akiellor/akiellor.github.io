<h1>How to solder</h1>
<p>I started building out my <a href="https://atreus.technomancy.us/">Atreus</a> keyboard today and the first step was to solder some diodes. Iâ€™d not really soldered before and the <a href="https://atreus.technomancy.us/assembly.pdf">assembly guide</a> referenced the <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering/tools">Ada Fruit Guide to Soldering</a>. This guide was awesome and really gave me some confidence to start my assembly.</p>
